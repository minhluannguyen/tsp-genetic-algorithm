# Playing around with Genetic Algorithm and the Travelling Salesman Problem

My attempt for solving TSP with Genetic Algorithm.

## Introduction

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. It focuses on optimization. In this problem, a salesman is given a list of cities, and must determine the shortest possible route that allows him to visit each city once and return to his original location.

## Genetic Algorithm

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce the offspring of the next generation.

## Implementation

Each individual in the population will be represented with:
- A "chromosome" with is encoded order of vistied cities.
- A fitness score to determine how good the solution is. In this case, it is $ \frac{1}{\text{total distance}} $ (since the shorter distance the better).

The algorithm will loop through a number of generations, and in each generation:
- Pick out the "survivors" (the best individuals) from the current population.
- Apply crossover and mutation to create the next generation.

This will repeat until a certain of generations. The better an individual is, the more likely it will be picked for reproduction.
